# BIOLM0051 – DNA Barcoding & Phylogenetic Analysis Project  
**Author**: Mohd Kamran Khan  
**Module:** BIOLM0051

##  Project Overview

This repository contains all data, scripts, alignments and phylogenetic trees created for the BIOLM0051 coursework.

The aims of the project were to:

1. Clean and process FASTQ files  
2. Convert merged reads into FASTA  
3. Translate DNA sequences into amino acids using **Biopython** (Translation Table 2)  
4. Perform **multiple sequence alignment (MSA)** using **Clustal Omega**  
5. Construct **phylogenetic trees** using **EBI Simple Phylogeny**  
6. Identify the likely species origins of three unknown samples (**Sample A, Sample B, Sample D**)

>  Note: Sample C contained corrupted sequence data (too many ambiguous “N” bases and formatting errors) and was excluded from downstream analysis.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis

### 1. Merge paired FASTQ files  

### 2. Clean FASTQ & convert to FASTA  

### 3. Translate DNA to protein  

### 4. Run multiple sequence alignment  
Uploaded FASTA files were aligned on **EMBL-EBI Clustal Omega**.

### 5. Build phylogenetic trees  
Aligned files sent to **EMBL-EBI Simple Phylogeny**.
